										<h3 class="major">Project Summary</h3>
										<p>The Course-Planner Web app allows for professors to create and modify courses in their respective degree programs using an admin control center I developed, and also allows for studets of the various degree programs to select among the created courses - those in which they've taken and their respecive grades for each course. It then generates a "New Pathway" entailing what courses the student must take in conjunction with the previously completed courses to graduate in four years. The Course Planner project was made in conjunction with two of my peers from WKU. This project was developed for my Software Engineering course and was my first professional project in which I adopted up a postion of leadership. 
											I learned a significant amount - about not only the Django framework, but the Software Development Cycle. The Course-Planner was fully documented over the course of its development (72 Pages) entailing all the process and the development cycle.

											<p>Developed with: <b>Python, Django, JavaScript, CSS, HTML</b></p></p>
